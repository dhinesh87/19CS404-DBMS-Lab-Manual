# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to Find employees who have an age less than the average age of employees with incomes over 2.5 Lakh

Employee Table

name             type

------------   ---------------

id                    INTEGER

name              TEXT

age                 INTEGER

city                 TEXT

income           INTEGER

```sql
SELECT id, name, age, city, income
FROM Employee
WHERE age < (
    SELECT AVG(age)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE income > 250000
);

```

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find salespeople who had more than one customer. Return salesman_id and name.

salesman table

```sql
SELECT s.salesman_id, s.name
FROM salesman s
JOIN customer c 
    ON s.salesman_id = c.salesman_id
GROUP BY s.salesman_id, s.name
HAVING COUNT(c.customer_id) > 1;

```

**Output:**

  o.purch_amt,
  o.ord_date,
  o.customer_id,

FROM
  orders AS o
JOIN
  salesman AS s
ON
  o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE
  s.city = 'New York';
```
